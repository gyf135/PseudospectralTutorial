`notebooks` folder contains two IJulia notebooks demonstrating:
1) differentiation of periodic functions in 1D and 2D periodic domains and,
2) solving 2D turbulence equation on a doubly periodic domain.

`codes` folder contains:
1) Three codes (python, julia, matlab) that solve 2D turbulence equation on a doubly periodic domain in the same manner as done in the notebook. 
2) An optimized version of the julia code.
3) A code that solves the equation on a beta-plane.
